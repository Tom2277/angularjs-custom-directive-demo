    <h3>This page has no AngularJS on it.</h3>
    <p>
      It does not use the angular-ui router either, of course. That will cause angular-ui-router links ('ui-ref') to break. You will want a separate navbar with normal links to insert via JavaScript or cut and paste onto all of your non routed pages.</p>
    <p>
      The router is great in terms of page reload time, and of course, it keeps you from generating separate pages with navbars and src="" references.</p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, however, you -Do- want a fresh page reload when your content changes. If you're running site with advertising on it for example, your client may feel that they've earned a new page view when there is  new content on the page?! </p>
    <p>
      Or maybe a client is attached to a HTML image map they made in 2003? Or perhaps they have legacy pages with many back links to them that they want to maintain as landing and soft-redirecting pages?</p>
    <h3>
      It's simple to use AngularJS on some pages and not others is simple when a site is up on simple s3 bucket and/or HTTP server.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Of course, rich dynamic sites are rarely that simple.
