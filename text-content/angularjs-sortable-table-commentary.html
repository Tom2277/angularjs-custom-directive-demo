<div class="col-md-7">
  <p>
    On this page, I use the same Angular JS directive to two sortable tables, using different data and a different check-box actions passed to the directive.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the far left table(or first on mobile)I have numerous Character names that you check to include the name in a second list. (You can sort that list too, but that's just a bell and whistle at this point.) The action is passed by name to the DOM extension the custom directive provides. The action itself resides on the given controller calling the shared directive.
  </p>  
</div>
<div class="col-md-5">
  <p>
    In the right column, the action from the check-box triggers the display of photos in a box above the table.
  </p>

    You can see my code and read more explanation in my <a href="http://tomnorian.com" >blog post on passing an action to a reusable AngularJS directive</a>
