<div class="col-md-7">
I use the same Angular JS directive to create sortable tables in both the far left column and the far right column.  On the left, data and column headers are supplied to the directive to add and remove content from the center column that shares a controller with the first column.
</div>
<div class="col-md-5">
In the right column, the action from the check-box triggers the display of photos in a box above the table.  See the tutorial for more information.
